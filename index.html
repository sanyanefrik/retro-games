							The game Pokemon - Fire Red Version is a re-release of the Red version, which, without exaggeration, conquered the whole world in the mid-nineties. The same authentic open world with ten cities and eight stadiums and a sea of Pokémon ready to fight for their trainer. The meaning of the game is simple, and this is its main value - the player will have to travel around the province of Kanto, fighting with other trainers, collecting Pokemon and overcoming the obstacles of Team R. The game will be interesting even to those who were not fans of the adventures of Ash and his team in the nineties: captivating storyline, unique characters, improved graphics compared to the first part, and collectibles.

							Princesses in the game world are stolen more often than phones in the subway. So Zelda fell into the clutches of the evil sorcerer Agahnim. And who to rescue her, if not the young hero Link. Moreover, his uncle also died, trying to save a person of royal blood. The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past is considered one of the best games in the series. After the mistakes of the second part, the developers listened to the wishes, so the continuation turned out to be perfect: convenient controls, no movement restrictions, close to the real action of weapons, multi-level dungeons in which it is easy to get lost - the game is addictive quickly and for a long time.

							Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles - The Hyperstone Heist

							There are three reasons for playing this game. First, it is in the top twenty for SEGA. Secondly, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles - The Hyperstone Heist is as close as possible to the plot of the animated series. Thirdly, this is a game about ninja turtles! "Honey, I Shrunk Manhattan!" (from Shredder's personal correspondence). Here is the plot itself. In order to prevent the villain in uncomfortable armor from shrinking the rest of the world, the turtles put on bandages, wax their shells and set off on a long and dangerous journey through five levels. Hit combos, unique fighting styles for each character, a peppy soundtrack, excellent humor, long locations and the most aggressive enemies in the entire series - all this makes the game both challenging and incredibly addictive.
